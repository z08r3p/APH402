Due   on   Tuesday,   November   19,   2024Question   1.   To   each   of   six   50.00   mL   volumetric   flasks,   5.00   mL   of   unknown   solution   containing   X   was   added carefully. Then   0.00,   2.00, 4.00,   6.00, 8.00   and   10.00   mL   (Vst) standard   solutions   with   the   concentration   of   X   as 1.00   μg/mL   were   added   to   the   flasks   separately. The   solution   mixtures   were   diluted   to   50.00   mL   and   were   then analyzed   using   UV-Vis   spectrometric   method   under   820 nm, giving   absorbance   (A) of   0.021, 0.045,   0.066,   0.084,   0.106, and   0.130 when   wave   path   length   was   1.00   cm.
1)         Which   calibration   method   was   used   in   the   experiment?   Comment   about   its   advantages.                                                    [6   marks]
2)         What are the other TWO most commonly used instrumental calibration   methods?   Describe the   process and   the   working   principles   for   the   two   methods   and   their   advantages.

3)         Assuming   that   the   absorbance   of   the   solutions   obeys   Beer’s   Law   (A   =   εbc),   derivate   A~Vst      equation   and process   the   experimental   data   with   Excel,   showing   the   absorbance   A   ~   Vst    diagram   along   with   the   R2    and   the   A   ~ Vst      equation, and   calculate   the   concentration   of   X   in   the   sample   solution.

4)         A   spectrophotometric      method   for   the      determination   of      Pb2+    in      blood      uses      Cu2+    as      internal   standard.   A   standard   sample   containing   1.75   ppb   Pb2+   and   2.25   ppb   of   Cu2+   gives   an   absorbance   of   0.48   and   0.20   for Pb2+   and   Cu2+,   respectively. To   analyze   an   unknown   sample,   10.0   mL   of   2.50   ppb   Cu2+    solution   was   added   to 10.0 mL   of   the   unknown   blood   sample, and   then   diluted   to   25.0   mL   with   a   volumetric   flask. The   absorbances measured   0.15 and   0.21 for   Pb2+    and   Cu2+,   respectively. Calculate   the   concentration   of   Pb2+    in   the   unknown blood   sample.                                                       [8    marks]
Question   2. The   van   Deemter   Equation   relates   the   linear   velocity   (μ) with   the   height   of   the   theoretical   plate   (H):   H   = A   +   B/μ +   Cμ

Question   3.   GC   separation   of   a   2-component   mixture,   with   a   20-meter   column,   resulted   in   a   chromatogram   shown   below.
1)         Calculate   the   standard   deviation   (σ), the   separation   factor   (α),the   resolution   (Rs), the   plate   number   (N) and the   plate   height   (H) of   these   two   components.

Question 4. Answer All Questions
1)       Sketch   diagrams   to   illustrate   the   effect   of   flow   rate   of   the   mobile   phase   (μ,   cm/s)   to   the   efficient   of   the column   (H,   mm) for   GC   and   LC,   respectively.

2)    An average HPLC column available today is able to achieve column efficiencies (N) of around 40,000   theoretical plates/m.    In   comparison,   even   the      best   capillary   GC   columns   are   only   able   to   achieve   8,000   theoretical   plates/m. Why then,   is GC capable of achieving   orders   of   magnitude   better   resolving   power   than   HPLC?   Explain   this   apparent   contradiction.                           [6    marks]
Question      5.      Reversed phase HPLC analysis was carried out for a pharmaceutical mixture contains 4-aminobenzoic   acid   (A),   salicylic   acid   (S)   and   benzoic   acid   (B),   where   the   stationary   phase   is   a   C18   chain   with polyfluorinated   aromatic   ring   at   the   end   of   the   chain.   If   a   30%   MeCN   aqueous   solution   is   used   as   the   mobile   with   a   UV   255   nm   detector,   discuss   the   necessity   of   controlling the   pH   of the   mobile   and the   relative   order   of   the   retention times for the three analytes at the   pH   you   proposed.
